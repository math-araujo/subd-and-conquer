# SubD and Conquer

(WIP) Study and implementation of subdivision techniques. Currently implemented Catmull-Clark subdivision surface for arbitrary topology meshes. Now working on table driven subdivision schemes.

In parallel to table driven subdivision implementation, I'm working on some rendering features for the OpenGL side. Currently, I'm working on the triangulation of the quads (since after one Catmull-Clark subdivision step, all the triangles and n-gons will be quadrangulated) to send the data to the GPU as triangles.

While I work on my custom OpenGL renderer for this task, below are presented some outputs generated by Polyscope to verify that the Catmull-Clark subdivision is working correctly. As control mesh, it was used a default cube (quad faces), a tetrahedron (triangular faces) and a dodecahedron (pentagonal faces), all created on Blender, demonstrating that the method works on meshes with n-gons. (By the way, here is a [very nice](https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/780) way to create dodecahedrons on Blender without add-ons!). The left column is the result of my subdivision implementation; right column is the subdivision generated on Blender (with the "Use Limit Surface" option disabled), saved as a Wavefront file and imported to Polyscope. In all cases, the control mesh is displayed as a transparent surface.

### Build Instructions

This project uses CMake as build system generator. It's necessary to have it installed on your system. Additionaly, `git submodules` is used to add `vcpkg` as a dependency manager and to add `geometry-central` as a dependency. Execute the following commands on the command-line to clone, configure and build the project:

```
# If you hadn't clone the repository yet:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/math-araujo/subd-and-conquer.git
# NOTE: Did you remember to clone recursively using --recurse-submodules?

cd subd-and-conquer

# On Windows + MSVC
cmake --preset=msvc

cmake --build build --config Release

# On Unix
cmake --preset=default-unix

cmake --build build

```

In case you forgot to clone the repository recursively, run the following command with the command line open on the root of the repository:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Feel free to open an issue should any problem arise. 

<details><summary>Failure to use FetchContent</summary>
Usually I don't use git submodules and use CMake FetchContent module, even for downloading and building vcpkg. However, an enigmatic error arised when trying to use FetchContent to download both vcpkg **and** geometry-central. The configuration was successfull using either one, but failed when I tried to use FetchContent for both repositories simultaneously. I'm still investigating this issue, but for the time being I settled with using both vcpkg and geometry-central through git-submodules.
